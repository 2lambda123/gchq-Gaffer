# GafferPop

GafferPop is a lightweight Gaffer implementation of the
[TinkerPop framework](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/), where TinkerPop methods
are delegated to Gaffer graph operations.

It is still in development. The implementation is basic and its performance is
unknown in comparison to using standard Gaffer `OperationChains`.

Please see the [official Gaffer documentation](https://gchq.github.io/gaffer-doc/latest/)
for more information on the current GafferPop implementation, some useful links are as follows:
